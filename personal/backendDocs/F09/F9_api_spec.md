# API Specification: F-009 — Leave Management

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Feature Summary
The Leave Management API provides a deterministic, role-driven workflow for employees to request time off and for organizations to approve or reject those requests through a structured approval chain. It enforces strict validation rules, mandatory rejection reasons, role-based visibility, and integrates notifications for key leave events without handling balances or payroll.

### 1.2 Key Capabilities
- Leave request submission with date range and half-day support
- Role-based approval workflows (Employee → Manager → HR, Manager → HR, HR → CEO)
- Mandatory validation rules (overlaps, non-working days)
- Leave cancellation by applicant
- Role-based visibility of leave requests
- Email and in-app notifications for leave workflow events (via F-003)

### 1.3 Out of Scope
- Leave balance tracking and accrual
- Editing leave requests after submission
- Approval for leave cancellation
- Notifications on leave cancellation
- Payroll or salary impact calculations

### 1.4 Dependencies
- **F-005 — Employee Management**: Employee data and relationships
- **F-002 — RBAC & Permission Engine**: Role-based access control
- **F-003 — Notifications System**: Email and in-app notifications

## 2. Global API Rules

### 2.1 Authentication

**JWT Token Structure:**
All API endpoints require JWT Bearer token authentication.

**Token Format:** `Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>`

**Required Claims in JWT Payload:**
- `sub` (subject): User ID (string, UUID format) - **REQUIRED**
- `role`: User role (string) - **REQUIRED** - Encoded in token, not database lookup
  - Values: `"superadmin"`, `"ceo"`, `"hr"`, `"manager"`, `"employee"`
- `org_id`: Organization ID (string, UUID format, nullable) - **REQUIRED**
  - `null` for SuperAdmin (global access)
  - UUID for company-scoped users (CEO, HR, Manager, Employee)
- `exp`: Token expiration timestamp (integer, Unix timestamp) - **REQUIRED**
- `iat`: Token issued at timestamp (integer, Unix timestamp) - **RECOMMENDED**
- `jti`: JWT ID (string, unique token identifier) - **RECOMMENDED** for token revocation

**JWT Payload Structure:**
```json
{
  "sub": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "role": "employee",
  "org_id": "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
  "exp": 1735689600,
  "iat": 1735686000,
  "jti": "jwt_abc123xyz789"
}
```

**Token Expiration:**
- Access tokens: 15 minutes to 1 hour
- Token refresh: Supported via separate endpoint (implementation TBD)

**Multi-tenancy:**
- Company context extracted from JWT token `org_id` claim
- All leave operations are scoped to the user's company (from token)
- SuperAdmin must specify company context for leave operations

**Error Responses:**
- `401 UNAUTHENTICATED`: Missing/invalid/expired token
- `401 TOKEN_EXPIRED`: Token expired
- `401 INVALID_TOKEN`: Malformed token or missing required claims

### 2.2 General Rules
- **Versioning**: All endpoints use `/api/v1/` prefix
- **Content-Type**: `application/json` for all requests/responses
- **Character Encoding**: UTF-8
- **DateTime Format**: ISO 8601 UTC with Z suffix (e.g., `2024-01-20T10:30:00Z`)
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests per minute per user (configurable)
- **Request Size Limit**: 1MB maximum payload size
- **Response Headers**: All responses MUST include `X-Request-ID` header for debugging and support

}
```

**Business Rules:**

**Approve Action:**
- User must be the assigned approver at the current workflow stage
- Cannot approve own leave request
- Manager can only approve at manager stage (`manager_status = PENDING_MANAGER`)
- HR can only approve at HR stage (`hr_status = PENDING_HR` and `manager_status = APPROVED_MANAGER`)
- CEO can only approve HR leave at CEO stage (`hr_status = PENDING_HR` and applicant role is HR)
- Updates appropriate status to `APPROVED_*` and sets `*_approved_at` timestamp
- If manager approves, workflow moves to HR stage (`hr_status` remains `PENDING_HR`)
- If HR approves, workflow completes (`hr_status = APPROVED_HR`)
- Triggers notification to next approver or applicant (via F-003)

**Reject Action:**
- User must be the assigned approver at the current workflow stage
- Cannot reject own leave request
- `rejection_reason` is mandatory
- Manager can only reject at manager stage
- HR can only reject at HR stage
- CEO can only reject HR leave at CEO stage
- Updates appropriate status to `REJECTED_*` and sets `*_rejection_reason`
- Workflow terminates (no further approvals possible)
- Triggers notification to applicant (via F-003)

**Cancel Action:**
- Only the applicant (employee who created the leave request) can cancel
- Can only cancel if leave request is pending (not approved or rejected)
- Sets both `manager_status` and `hr_status` to `CANCELLED`
- Triggers notifications to manager approver and HR approver
- Workflow terminates

**Workflow State Transitions:**

**Employee Leave:**
1. Created → `manager_status = PENDING_MANAGER`, `hr_status = PENDING_HR`
2. Manager approves → `manager_status = APPROVED_MANAGER`, `hr_status = PENDING_HR`
3. HR approves → `hr_status = APPROVED_HR` (complete)
4. Manager rejects → `manager_status = REJECTED_MANAGER` (terminated)
5. HR rejects → `hr_status = REJECTED_HR` (terminated)

**Manager Leave:**
1. Created → `manager_status = PENDING_MANAGER`, `hr_status = PENDING_HR`
2. Manager stage skipped (manager is applicant) → `manager_status = APPROVED_MANAGER`, `hr_status = PENDING_HR`
3. HR approves → `hr_status = APPROVED_HR` (complete)
4. HR rejects → `hr_status = REJECTED_HR` (terminated)

**HR Leave:**
1. Created → `manager_status = PENDING_MANAGER`, `hr_status = PENDING_HR`
2. Manager stage skipped → `manager_status = APPROVED_MANAGER`, `hr_status = PENDING_HR`
3. HR stage skipped (HR is applicant) → `hr_status = APPROVED_HR` (CEO approval required, but no CEO approver field - handled via role check)
4. CEO approves → `hr_status = APPROVED_HR` (complete)
5. CEO rejects → `hr_status = REJECTED_HR` (terminated)

## 5. Webhooks / Async Behavior

### 5.1 Notifications (F-003 Integration)

**Trigger Events:**
- Leave request created → Notification to manager approver and HR approver (informational)
- Leave request approved (manager stage) → Notification to HR approver and applicant
- Leave request approved (HR stage) → Notification to applicant
- Leave request rejected (manager stage) → Notification to applicant
- Leave request rejected (HR stage) → Notification to applicant
- Leave request cancelled → Notification to manager approver and HR approver

**Notification Details:**
- Notification system (F-003) handles email and in-app notifications
- Notification payload includes leave request details and action taken
- Implementation details are in F-003 specification

---

## 6. Rate Limiting & Performance

### 6.1 Rate Limiting
- **Default**: 100 requests per minute per user (configurable)
- **Burst**: Up to 10 requests per second
- **Rate Limit Headers**: Included in responses (if applicable)

### 6.2 Performance Considerations
- List endpoint supports pagination to limit response size
- Filtering and sorting are performed server-side
- ETag-based cache validation reduces bandwidth for unchanged resources
- Database indexes recommended on: `employee_id`, `company_id`, `manager_status`, `hr_status`, `start_date`, `end_date`

## 7. Open Questions

None identified at this stage.

---

## 8. Assumptions

1. **Employee Management (F-005)**: Employee data, manager relationships, and active status are available
2. **RBAC (F-002)**: Role-based permissions and access control are enforced
3. **Notifications (F-003)**: Notification system handles email and in-app notifications for leave events
4. **Working Days**: System has access to working day calendar (weekends and holidays are excluded)
5. **Company Context**: All operations are scoped to the company from JWT token `org_id` claim
6. **Approver Assignment**: Users provide `manager_approver_id` and `hr_approver_id` during creation, validated to be in same company with correct roles
7. **Number of Days Calculation**: Calculated from date range and `day_type` (half-days = 0.5, full days = 1.0 per day)
8. **Concurrency Control**: ETags based on `updated_at` timestamp prevent lost updates
9. **Status Representation**: Both `manager_status` and `hr_status` are exposed separately (no computed overall status)
10. **Cancellation**: Only applicant can cancel, only while pending, notifications sent to approvers
