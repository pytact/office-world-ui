Feature Brief: F-008 — Task Management & Assignment
1. Context & Problem

Background: officeWorld requires a robust task execution layer to support daily operational work across companies. Tasks are the primary unit of work and may optionally be grouped into projects.

Current Pain / Problem: Without a clear task ownership model and granular permissions, task collaboration can become confusing, insecure, and hard to govern.

Why Now: Task execution is core to employee productivity and underpins project management, notifications, and operational visibility.

2. Goal / Outcome

Primary Goal: Enable structured task creation, assignment, and execution with clear ownership and permission boundaries.

Secondary Goals:

Support multi-assignee collaboration with controlled permissions

Ensure task visibility aligns with organizational roles

Success Criteria (Business View):

Tasks can be created, assigned, updated, and completed reliably

Task ownership and permission rules are consistently enforced

Relevant users receive timely notifications for task events

3. In Scope

Task creation, editing, and deletion

Task ownership (creator as immutable owner)

Multi-user task assignment

Viewer and Editor permission model

Task status lifecycle management

Optional linkage of tasks to projects

Task visibility based on role and assignment

Email and in-app notifications for task events

4. Out of Scope

Project-level permissions

Task priority or due date management

Task comments by viewers

Bulk task operations

Soft deletion of tasks

5. Primary Actors
Actor	Description
CEO	Full control over all tasks
Manager	Full control over all tasks
HR	View-only access to tasks
Employee	Can create, view, and manage own tasks
6. User Stories
