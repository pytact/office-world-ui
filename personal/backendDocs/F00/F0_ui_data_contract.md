1. Feature Summary

The Core Platform Foundation feature provides the authentication and onboarding backbone of the officeWorld platform. It enables secure login, invitation-based user activation, password reset flows, and SuperAdmin access, while enforcing multi-tenant isolation and role-based governance. All other platform features depend on this foundation.

2. Screens Covered
- SCR_AUTH_LOGIN
- SCR_AUTH_ACTIVATION
- SCR_AUTH_PASSWORD_RESET_REQUEST
- SCR_AUTH_PASSWORD_RESET

4. Proposed API Hints (Not Final API Spec)
Proposed API Hints:
- POST /api/v1/auth/login
- POST /api/v1/auth/logout
- GET  /api/v1/auth/activation/{token}
- POST /api/v1/auth/activation/{token}
- POST /api/v1/auth/password-reset/request
- POST /api/v1/auth/password-reset/{token}


Endpoint structure is indicative only; schemas and auth mechanics are defined by the API Spec Builder.

5. Cross-Screen Data Dependencies
SCR_AUTH_ACTIVATION and SCR_AUTH_PASSWORD_RESET both require:
- CredentialToken (User.token)
- Token expiry evaluation

SCR_AUTH_LOGIN and downstream features share:
- AuthenticatedUserContext
  - User
  - Role
  - Company (nullable)

6. Data Edge Cases

Invalid login credentials (no user match or wrong password)

Deactivated or soft-deleted users attempting login

Expired invitation token during activation

Already-activated user revisiting activation link

Expired or reused password reset token

SuperAdmin user with no company context

Company marked inactive blocking user access
