Feature Brief: F-011 — Audit Logging & Activity History
1. Context & Problem

Background: officeWorld operates across sensitive domains such as user access, employee data, salaries, attendance, and approvals. These actions require full traceability for security, compliance, and accountability.

Current Pain / Problem: Without a centralized audit trail, it is difficult to investigate incidents, verify actions, or ensure compliance across critical workflows.

Why Now: As more sensitive features (salary, leave, attendance) go live, a system-wide, immutable audit layer is mandatory.

2. Goal / Outcome

Primary Goal: Provide a comprehensive, immutable audit logging system that records all critical actions across the platform.

Secondary Goals:

Enable role-based visibility into audit history

Ensure audit logging does not impact system performance

Success Criteria (Business View):

All critical actions are consistently logged

Audit logs are tamper-proof and permanently retained

Authorized roles can review audit history relevant to them

3. In Scope

Audit logging for all major system actions across features

System-generated and user-generated action logging

Role-based audit log visibility

Asynchronous audit event processing

Permanent retention of audit logs

4. Out of Scope

Editing or deleting audit logs

End-user access to audit logs

Exporting or external sharing of audit logs

Real-time alerting based on audit events

5. Primary Actors
Actor	Description
System	Emits audit events asynchronously
CEO	Views all company-level audit logs
HR	Views all company-level audit logs
Manager	Views task and project–related audit logs only
6. User Stories

As a CEO, I want to view all audit logs for my company so that actions are transparent and accountable.

As HR, I want to review audit history so that sensitive operations can be verified.

As a Manager, I want to see audit logs related to tasks and projects so that work activity is traceable.

As the system, I want to record actions without blocking user workflows.

7. Constraints & Assumptions
Constraints

Audit logs are never editable

Audit logs are never deletable

All critical actions must generate audit events

Audit logging must not block business operations

Assumptions

Audit logs are retained indefinitely

System-generated actions are logged using a SYSTEM actor

Audit events are processed asynchronously

Failure to write an audit log does not fail the originating action
