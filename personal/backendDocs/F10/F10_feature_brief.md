Feature Brief: F-010 — Attendance Management
1. Context & Problem

Background: officeWorld needs a reliable way to track employee presence and working hours on a daily basis. Attendance data must be accurate, tamper-resistant, and consistent across refreshes, logins, and devices.

Current Pain / Problem: Client-side timers and editable attendance records lead to incorrect data, manipulation risks, and lack of trust in attendance reports.

Why Now: Attendance is a foundational operational feature required before analytics, compliance reporting, and future payroll integrations.

2. Goal / Outcome

Primary Goal: Implement a server-time–based attendance system with mandatory check-in and check-out.

Secondary Goals:

Display a live working-time counter for the current day

Enforce immutable attendance records

Success Criteria (Business View):

Attendance remains accurate across refresh, logout, and re-login

Daily worked time is calculated correctly per employee timezone

Attendance data cannot be edited or manipulated

3. In Scope

Daily check-in and check-out

Mandatory check-out

Server-time–based live working-time counter

Total worked time calculation per day

Employee-local timezone handling

Role-based attendance visibility

Immutable attendance records

4. Out of Scope

Break tracking

Manual attendance edits or corrections

Attendance approval workflows

Payroll or salary calculations

SuperAdmin access to attendance data

5. Primary Actors
Actor	Description
Employee	Checks in/out and views own attendance
Manager	Views attendance of all employees
HR	Full attendance visibility
CEO	Full attendance visibility
System	Calculates time using server timestamps
