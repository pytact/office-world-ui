# Project: officeWorld
# Feature: F-008 — Task Management

## Purpose
Provide a focused, execution-oriented task system where work is created, owned,
assigned, and completed with strict ownership rules, fine-grained assignment
permissions, and clear visibility boundaries. Tasks are independent units of work
that may optionally belong to projects, without inheriting project visibility.
