Feature Brief: F-012 — Reports & Analytics
1. Context & Problem

Background: officeWorld captures rich operational data across attendance, leave, salary, tasks, projects, employees, and audits. Decision-makers need consolidated, read-only insights to monitor performance and compliance.

Current Pain / Problem: Without centralized reporting, stakeholders rely on fragmented views across modules, making oversight slow and error-prone.

Why Now: With core operational features stabilized (F-001 → F-011), a unified reporting layer is required to extract value and enable informed decisions.

2. Goal / Outcome

Primary Goal: Provide role-based, company-scoped reports with near real-time data and PDF export.

Secondary Goals:

Enable consistent filters and dimensions across reports

Ensure strict visibility aligned with RBAC

Success Criteria (Business View):

Stakeholders can access relevant reports without data mutation

Reports reflect near real-time system state

Exports respect permissions and applied filters

3. In Scope

Read-only dashboards and tabular reports

Attendance reports (daily/monthly, employee-wise)

Leave reports (applied/approved/rejected)

Salary reports (aggregated only)

Employee reports (headcount, department-wise)

Task & Project reports (status, progress, assignments)

Audit summary reports (counts and trends)

Common filters (date range, employee, department, project, status)

PDF export for reports

4. Out of Scope

Cross-company reporting

Per-employee salary breakdowns

Raw audit log browsing

Custom report builders

Scheduled or emailed reports

Data editing from reports

5. Primary Actors
