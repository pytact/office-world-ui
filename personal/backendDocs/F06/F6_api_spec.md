# API Specification: F-006 — Salary Management

## 1. Overview

This API specification defines the RESTful endpoints for the Salary Management feature (F-006) in the officeWorld system. The feature provides secure, auditable, and time-based salary management that defines employee compensation, maintains immutable salary history, manages bank details, executes salary payments, and delivers downloadable salary slips to employees, with strict role-based access control.

**Feature Dependencies:**
- F-005 — Employee Management (required for employee context)
- F-002 — RBAC & Permission Engine (required for authorization)
- F-003 — Notifications System (required for salary slip email delivery)
- F-011 — Audit Logging (required for audit trail)

**Out of Scope:**
- Employee self-service salary views (V1)
- Multiple bank accounts per employee
- Payroll tax calculations
- Salary analytics or reporting
- Hard deletion of salary or bank records

---

## 2. Global API Rules

### 2.1 Authentication

**JWT Token Structure:**
All API endpoints require JWT Bearer token authentication.

**Token Format:** `Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>`

**Required Claims in JWT Payload:**
- `sub` (subject): User ID (string, UUID format) - **REQUIRED**
- `role`: User role (string) - **REQUIRED** - Encoded in token, not database lookup
- `org_id`: Organization ID (string, UUID format, nullable) - **REQUIRED** - `null` for SuperAdmin, UUID for org-scoped users
- `exp`: Token expiration timestamp (integer, Unix timestamp) - **REQUIRED**
- `iat`: Token issued at timestamp (integer, Unix timestamp) - **RECOMMENDED**
- `jti`: JWT ID (string, unique token identifier) - **RECOMMENDED** for token revocation

**JWT Payload Example:**
```json
{
  "sub": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "role": "hr",
  "org_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "exp": 1735689600,
  "iat": 1735686000,
  "jti": "jwt_abc123xyz789"
}
```

**Role Values:**
- `"superadmin"` - Global access, `org_id` is `null`
- `"ceo"` - Full access to all salary data within organization
- `"hr"` - Manages salary configuration and payments within organization
- `"employee"` - No API access (receives salary slips via email only)
- `"manager"` - No access to salary data

**Token Validation:**
- Server MUST validate token signature, expiration, and required claims
- Missing or invalid token: Return `401 UNAUTHENTICATED`
- Expired token: Return `401 UNAUTHENTICATED` with error code `TOKEN_EXPIRED`
- Missing required claims: Return `401 UNAUTHENTICATED` with error code `INVALID_TOKEN`

### 2.2 Multi-Tenancy

- **SuperAdmin**: `org_id: null` - Has access to all organizations
- **Organization-scoped users** (CEO, HR): `org_id: "<uuid>"` - Access limited to specified organization
- Server MUST extract `org_id` from token for authorization checks
- All salary data is scoped to the organization from the token's `org_id` claim

### 2.3 Timezone Standard

**All datetime fields MUST use UTC timezone** (ISO 8601 format with `Z` suffix).

- Format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` (e.g., `2024-01-20T10:30:00Z`)
- All `created_at`, `updated_at`, `paid_on`, `effective_from`, `effective_to` fields are in UTC
- Date-only fields: `YYYY-MM-DD` format (e.g., `2024-01-20`)

### 2.4 Response Headers

**ALL responses MUST include:**
- `X-Request-ID`: Unique request identifier for debugging (e.g., `req_abc123xyz789`) - **REQUIRED in ALL responses**

**For GET responses (resources that support updates):**
- `ETag`: Resource version identifier based on `updated_at` timestamp (e.g., `"20240120T103000Z"`)
- `Last-Modified`: Timestamp of last modification from `updated_at` field (optional, RFC 1123 format)

**For PATCH/PUT/DELETE requests:**
- `If-Match`: ETag value from GET response (REQUIRED for concurrency control)

**For GET requests (cache validation):**
- `If-None-Match`: ETag value from previous GET (optional, returns 304 if unchanged)

All endpoint router implementations MUST use centralized documentation classes. Create `SalaryApiDocs` class in `src/salary/documentations/salary_api_doc.py` (or appropriate module path) with `summary` and `description` for each endpoint operation. Use `summary=SalaryApiDocs.operation_name.summary` and `description=SalaryApiDocs.operation_name.description` in router decorators instead of hardcoded strings.

- No salary history entry created for initial salary
- No overlapping effective periods (system validates)
- User provides both `effective_from` and `effective_to` for the new SalaryDetails record
- Creating new SalaryDetails automatically sets `effective_to` on the previous active record to `effective_from - 1 day` (to prevent overlap)
- System creates SalaryHistory entry automatically when creating salary if previous salary existed
- If no previous SalaryDetails exists, this becomes the first record (no SalaryHistory entry created)

- **Headers:**
  - **Request Headers:**
    - `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (REQUIRED)

  - **Response Headers (REQUIRED):**
    - `X-Request-ID: req_abc123xyz789` (REQUIRED - for debugging and support)

**Request Body**

Same as POST endpoint (Section 4.3.2).

**Backend Logic:**
1. Fetch active salary
2. Set effective_to = effective_from - 1 day (yesterday relative to new effective_from)
3. Insert new salary record with new amount, effective_from = today, effective_to = NULL

**Business Rules:**
- Requires active salary to exist (returns 400 if no active salary - use create endpoint instead)
- Never updates in-place - always closes old record and creates new one
- Creates SalaryHistory entry automatically
- Validates no overlapping effective periods (excluding the active salary being closed)

**Success Response (200 OK)**

Same format as POST endpoint (Section 4.3.2), with message: "Salary revised successfully"

## 5. Webhooks / Async Behavior

### 5.1 Salary Slip Generation

**Async Operation:** When a SalaryPayment is created via `POST /v1/company/employees/{employee_id}/salary/salary-payments/run`, the system:

1. Creates the SalaryPayment record immediately (synchronous)
2. Triggers async salary slip generation (background job)
3. Triggers async email delivery via F-003 (Notifications System)

**Error Handling:**
- If salary slip generation fails, the payment record is still created
- Server returns `500 ASYNC_OPERATION_FAILED` if async operations fail (payment still created)
- Salary slip may not be immediately available for download after payment creation
- Clients should poll or wait before attempting to download the slip

**Email Delivery:**
- Salary slip is automatically emailed to the employee's registered email address
- Email delivery is handled by F-003 (Notifications System)
- Email includes download link to the salary slip
- Email delivery failures are logged but do not affect payment record creation

### 5.2 Audit Logging

**All salary-related actions generate audit logs** via F-011 (Audit Logging):

- Creating/updating SalaryDetails → Audit log entry
- Updating BankInfo → Audit log entry
- Creating SalaryPayment → Audit log entry
- SalaryHistory entries are automatically created when SalaryDetails change

## 6. Rate Limiting & Performance

### 6.1 Rate Limiting

- Standard rate limiting applies to all endpoints
- Salary payment creation may have stricter rate limits to prevent abuse
- File download endpoints may have bandwidth limits

### 6.2 Performance Considerations

- Salary overview endpoint aggregates data from multiple sources (may be slower)
- Pagination is required for salary payment lists to ensure performance
- Salary slip generation is async to avoid blocking payment creation
- ETag support enables efficient cache validation for GET requests

### 6.3 Caching

- GET endpoints support ETag-based caching (If-None-Match header)
- Clients should cache salary overview data and validate with ETag
- Salary slip files may be cached by CDN (if applicable)

## 7. Open Questions

None identified at this stage.

---

## 8. Assumptions

1. **Employee Management (F-005):** Employee records exist and are accessible before salary configuration
2. **RBAC (F-002):** Role-based access control is enforced at the API gateway/middleware level
3. **Notifications (F-003):** Email delivery service is available and configured for salary slip delivery
4. **Audit Logging (F-011):** Audit logging system is available and automatically logs all salary-related actions
5. **Salary Slip Generation:** External service/template is available for generating salary slip PDFs
6. **Multi-tenancy:** All salary data is scoped to the organization from the JWT token's `org_id` claim
7. **Data Immutability:** SalaryPayment and SalaryHistory records are never modified or deleted (append-only). Salary payments are legal records and PUT/DELETE operations are forbidden.
8. **BankInfo Updates:** Updates to BankInfo affect future salary payments only, past payments remain unchanged
9. **No Retroactive Recalculation:** System does not support retroactive salary recalculation
10. **Payment Execution:** Salary payment execution is done via `POST /salary-payments/run` endpoint (used by HR and automated payroll jobs)

## 10. Data Masking Rules

### 10.1 Bank Account Number Masking

- **Format:** Show last 4 characters, mask rest with `*`
- **Example:** `1234567890123456` → `****3456`
- **Applied in:** All API responses containing `account_number` field

### 10.2 IFSC Code Masking

- **Format:** Show first 4 characters (bank code), mask rest with `*`
- **Example:** `HDFC0001234` → `HDFC****234`
- **Applied in:** All API responses containing `ifsc_code` field

### 10.3 Masking Application

- Masking is applied in all GET responses
- Masking is applied in all POST/PATCH responses
- Unmasked data is only available internally (not exposed via API)
- Masking rules are consistent across all endpoints
